**MNIST Digit Recognition using TensorFlow and OpenCV**

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow for recognizing hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. OpenCV is used to preprocess live video frames from a webcam and provide real-time predictions.


**Prerequisites**


Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
Python (3.7 or later)
TensorFlow
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy


The application will display live video from the webcam along with real-time predictions of the recognized digits.
